# Introduction to the ALOS Project

# ALOS Project

ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) Project is a series of Japanese earth observation satellites. The latest one was *supposed to be* the ALOS-3 satellite.

# The Satellites

#### ALOS (Daichi)

#### ALOS-2 (Daichi-2)

]

.pull-left[

- Operation: 2006 - 2011
- Sensors: 
  - PALSAR (Active Radar)
  - PRISM (Panchromatic) 
  - AVENIR (RGB + NIR)
- Significance lies in the fact that there were multiple sensors in one satellite, allowing for detailed observation

]

.pull-right[

- Operation: 2014 - present
- Sensor: PALSAR-2 (Active Radar)
- Launched as successor to the PALSAR radar in ALOS

> 'Vast land' in Japanese

# Future projects

.pull-left[

#### ALOS-3 (failed)

![](https://www.satnavi.jaxa.jp/ja/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/top_image.png)

- Launched in 2023, but failed
- Sensor: 6 bands (including RGB, NIR)
- Had a spatial resolution of 0.7 m
- Designed as a successor to the AVENIR in ALOS; loss of this satellite cast a shadow in the future earth observation


]


.pull-right[

#### ALOS-4

![](https://www.satnavi.jaxa.jp/ja/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/top_image-1.png)

- Planned launch in 2024
- Sensor: Radar
- Planned as successor to ALOS-2
- Cannot be a substitute for the loss of ALOS-3, due to the difference in bands.

# Applications: Disaster observation

Observing of disasters is one of the focus areas by ALOS. [(JAXA, 2011)](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/img_up/dis_opt_tohokueq_110314.htm)

#### Aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake (2011)

The image of the coastline near Natori, Miyagi, Japan. Image taken 2 weeks after (left), 3 days after (centre), and before the earthquake and tsunami (right). We can see the tsunami-impacted ares in the centre, and the flooding ceased after 2 weeks.

# Applications: Vegetation analysis

Deforestation occuring worldwide has been observed, using the Radar image from Daichi-2. Downloadable for further research and analysis.

# Reflection

The ALOS projects have contributed to the growth of Japanese earth observation, with observation available for various wavelengths.

Disaster observation is of importance to the Japanese community as a whole. Global observation enables analysis for disasters worldwide, recent example being the [earthquake in Turkey](https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/earthview/2023/02/14/7381/index.html).

The failure of ALOS-3 may impact the earth observation of Japan, especially with the importance lying in disaster management that happens every once in a while.

> Japan has this past of losing a weather forcast satellite in 2003, forcing them to lend satellite data from the US for a few years. <br \> 
> 
> SO BAD we don't learn from mistakes!

### To Do: Use the data from ALOS!

I personally feel proud my country is using their own satellites for earth observation. I hope to dig further in to this dataset, and see what we can do!
