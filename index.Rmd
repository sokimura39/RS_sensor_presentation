Earth observation satellites from Japan

]

.pull-right[

ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) Project is a series of Japanese earth observation satellites. The latest one was *supposed to be* the ALOS-3 satellite.

There have been 2 satellites that have been launched in the past - ALOS 1 and 2.

ALOS 3 has failed to launch, and ALOS 4 is under development.

These satellites are a combination of SAR satellites and optical imagery observation satellites - they make up the main satellites for Japanese earth observation.

## The Satellites


.pull-left[

#### ALOS (Daichi)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('https://www.satnavi.jaxa.jp/ja/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/top_image.png')

```

]


.pull-right[

#### ALOS-2 (Daichi-2)


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('https://www.satnavi.jaxa.jp/ja/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/top_image-11.png')

```

]

.pull-left[

- Operation: 2006 - 2011
- Sensors: 
  - PALSAR (Active Radar)
  - PRISM (Panchromatic) 
  - AVENIR (RGB + NIR)
- Significance lies in the fact that there were multiple sensors in one satellite, allowing for detailed observation

]

.pull-right[

- Operation: 2014 - present
- Sensor: PALSAR-2 (Active Radar)
- Launched as successor to the PALSAR radar in ALOS

> The name *'Daichi'*: 「**大地**」literally means **land**

## Future projects

.pull-left[

#### ALOS-3 (failed)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('https://www.satnavi.jaxa.jp/ja/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/top_image.png')

```

]

.pull-right[

#### ALOS-4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('https://www.satnavi.jaxa.jp/ja/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/top_image-1.png')

```

]

.pull-left[

- Launched in 2023, but failed
- Sensor: 6 bands (including RGB, NIR)
- Had a spatial resolution of 0.7 m
- Designed as a successor to the AVENIR in ALOS; loss of this satellite cast a shadow in the future earth observation

]

.pull-right[

- Planned launch in 2024
- Sensor: Radar
- Planned as successor to ALOS-2
- Cannot be a substitute for the loss of ALOS-3, due to the difference in bands.

## Applications: Disaster observation

#### Aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake (2011)

Observing of disasters is one of the focus areas by ALOS. `r Citep(myBib, 'jaxa2011', 'jaxa2011a')`


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/new/opt_110328_tohoku/l_dis_av2_tohokueq_110328_f8.jpg')

```

The image of the coastline near Natori, Miyagi, Japan. Image taken 2 weeks after (left), 3 days after (centre), and before the earthquake and tsunami (right). We can see the tsunami-impacted ares in the centre, and the flooding ceased after 2 weeks.

---

## Applications: Vegetation analysis

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/jp/dataset/images/Global_fnf-mosaic_2019-2017.jpg')

```

Deforestation occuring worldwide has been observed, using the Radar image from Daichi-2.
`r Citet(myBib, 'whittle2012')` explored the deforestation of Sumatra, Indonesia using this dataset - an automatic deforestation detection was made possible, enabling them for simultaneous detection.

---

## Applications: Notes

The 2 research papers I have found using the ALOS data are both in Asia.

Being the Japanese alternative to the NASA and ESA ovservations, it may be interesting to figure out whether there is a regional preference toward using these observations compared to the alternatives.

There seems to be a lot of research comparing the observations of the multiple suites of satellites.


---

## Reflection

The ALOS projects have contributed to the growth of Japanese earth observation, with observation available for various wavelengths.

Disaster observation is of importance to the Japanese community as a whole. Global observation enables analysis for disasters worldwide, recent example being the earthquake in Turkey `r Citep(myBib, 'jaxa2023')`.

The failure of ALOS-3 may impact the earth observation of Japan, especially with the importance lying in disaster management that happens every once in a while.

> Japan has this past of losing a weather forcast satellite in 2003, forcing them to lend satellite data from the US for a few years. Hope the next ones will succeed!

### To Do: Use the data from ALOS!

I personally feel proud my country is using their own satellites for earth observation. I hope to dig further in to this dataset, and see what we can do!
